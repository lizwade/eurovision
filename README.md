# eurovision

This project was inspired by my love of the Eurovision Song Contest, 
in an attempt to answer the age old question: is it about music or politics?

The jupyter notebook uses math, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Thanks to datagraver for the dataset, which is available from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datagraver/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752018'
This notebook also makes use of national corruption data downloaded from the World Governance Indicators at www.govindicators.org
although that data did not make it into the final blogpost, which you can read at https://32yearslater204330699.wordpress.com/2019/02/02/eurovision-music-or-politics/
