## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The Anaconda distribution of Python contains all necessary libraries to run this code.  There should be no issues running this code should using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project was inspired by my love of the Eurovision Song Contest, and attempts to answer the age old question: is it about music or politics? Specifically, my code addresses the following questions:

1. How consistent are votes across the years?
2. Do countries reciprocate votes?
3. Are jury votes democratic?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repo contains 1 notebook, holding work related to the above questions. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

You can read about the findings from this code in my blog post at https://32yearslater204330699.wordpress.com/2019/02/02/eurovision-music-or-politics/

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Thanks to datagraver for the dataset, which is available from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datagraver/eurovision-song-contest-scores-19752018'

This notebook also makes use of national corruption data downloaded from the World Governance Indicators at www.govindicators.org
although that data did not make it into the final blogpost. You are welcome to use my code as you wish.
